# Investigation of Generative Adversarial Networks and Their Comparative Parametric Analysis

The performance of GANs is highly dependent on their hyperparameters and architecture, and selecting the best set of parameters
can be challenging. This paper investigates the performance of different GAN architectures and their corresponding hyperparameters through a comprehensive comparative parametric analysis. We evaluate the performance of GANs using multiple quantitative metrics such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), F1 score, precision and recall. This study comprehensively evaluates GANs and their parameters, enabling researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions when using GANs for synthetic data generation.
